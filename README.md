RFM22B From HopeRF 2D Footprint and 3D model for use in KiCAD and other software 3D Model created using Fusion 360,
the spacing is very rough, but size of IC, voltage regulator, SMDs,
and Crystal Oscillator are accurate using calipers, other dimensions from the datasheet [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/RFM22.PDF) followed as well.
Schematic Symbol, PCB Layout, and 3D Model for the RFM22B Are shown below and included in this Repository 
The step file is (obviously) the 3D model of the development board/module, "PersonalSymbolsBuilt.kicad_sym" is the library for part, and the folder "PersonalFootprintsBuilt.pretty" contains the footprint for the RFM22B.

Hope this helps someone, someday!
